Washington - United States officials on Wednesday alerted lawmakers about a potential threat to the Capitol on March 4 and have heightened security as a precaution. Citing sources, according to a report by CNN, the information provided by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned of increased chatter among extremists, including members of the Three Percenters extremist group, discussing possible plots against the Capitol on March 4, a date that conspiracy theorists have focused on. Amid the security threat, security has also been enhanced in the area as a precaution. According to an official statement by the US Capitol Police, it had obtained intelligence of a "possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4." More than 300 people now face federal charges in connection with the January 6 riot on Capitol Hill and at least 280 people have been arrested, The Hill reported citing the Justice Department's statement last month. Those figures come over a month after a mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an unsuccessful attempt to halt Congress's certification of the Electoral College.   Moreover, several people died in the riot, including one police officer as well as one Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. Among the rioters were members of several right-wing militia groups, including the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters, The Hill reported. Earlier, Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman had told lawmakers that, "We know that members of the militia groups that were present on January 6 have stated their desires that they want to blow up the Capitol and kill as many members as possible with a direct nexus to the State of the Union." "Based on that information, we think that it is prudent that Capitol Police maintain its enhanced and robust security posture until we address those vulnerabilities," she had added.
