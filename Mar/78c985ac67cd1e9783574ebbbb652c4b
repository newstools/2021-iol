Zenariah Barends pay tribute to veteran journalist Karima Brown who died of complications due to Covid-19 this week. Ode to a Wild Woman (for Karima Brown) How will we be in this world without you? Oh wild woman oh fierce spirit sharpened to pierce the hidden veil driven by your uncompromising vigilance You travelled the unenviable path of the hero Fom behind your framed eyes You roared with a smile Springing from your incisive mind laced with wisdom your questions unveiled forbidden cities rendered visible spiraling castles built on blood made public avaricious deceit unmasked the oozing slime of our country's underbelly pointed out who would be Ozymandias* amongst us The storyteller tells of women who run amongst wolves ** of curious women who leap from wily traps that would ensnare them who dart from those who would imprison them Wild, wonderful women sisters, mothers, daughters, lovers blissfully dancing as they rip the spiteful corset that constrains them Fighting and loving hard who cherish their children as life itself Oh how we grieve wild woman this is not the end You watered your garden well my love precious flowers bloom as holy tears fall a river flows to the boundless ocean so take a deep rest when you find that soft shore Your life's work so profound will shine golden like the brightest of stars * References: Ozymandias - a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley and Women who run with the Wolves - Dr Clarissa Pinkola Estes ** Zenariah Barends is former chief of staff at Independent Media and current head of publications at Community Chest.
