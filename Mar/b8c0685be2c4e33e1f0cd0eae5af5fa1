Durban - Hilton College, which turns 150 next year, has thrown out a line in search of stories. A book, marking its sesquicentennial anniversary, “aims to feature remarkable aspects of Hilton College and the impact of our community on the world”, according to a circular sent to the school community. Brett Armstong, the school’s 150th anniversary co-ordinator, said while the school had appealed to staff, ex-staff and parents, it also believed the wider community would add value. “The more content to consider the better,” he said. The school is seeking motivations for its research team, headed by David Larsen, of Africa Media Online, on Hiltonians who may be “truly world class, extraordinary, remarkable, legendary, visionary or iconic in medicine, business, spirituality, arts, humanities, environment, academia, military, sport, politics, law, exploration or any other field of life". Armstrong estimates that there are about 14 000 living Old Hiltonians. In 1972, Hilton College produced a book, Lift Up Your Hearts by Neville Nuttall, to mark its centenary. Last year the Independent on Saturday reported that the school’s quest to find its oldest living old boy had resulted in 98-year-old Michael Hathorn making contact from the United Kingdom. He is a former medical doctor, aircraft engineer, anti-apartheid activist with a son who also went to Hilton. Anyone with information for the book can contact Armstrong at 150@hiltoncollege.com by March 26. The Independent on Saturday
