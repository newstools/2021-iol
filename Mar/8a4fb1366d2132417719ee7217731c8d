Cape Town - The  Iziko Museums of South Africa is gearing up to host a virtual public discussion in commemoration of Human Rights Day. Titled “What does Human Rights Day mean in the times of Covid-19 and post-apartheid South Africa?” the discussion will feature presentations by SA Human Rights Commissioner Reverend Chris Nissen, socio-economic equality advocate Kgotsi Chikane, and former South African ambassador to Japan, Mohau Pheko. Human Rights Day is observed every year on March 21, in commemoration of the 1960 Sharpeville Massacre. On that day compatriots across the country embarked on protest march against pass laws, led by the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania.
