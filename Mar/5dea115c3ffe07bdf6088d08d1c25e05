Johannesburg - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says 107 054 healthcare workers have now been vaccinated in the country since the Johnson & Johnson doses arrived in February. South Africa kicked off its mass vaccination programme in February after the J&J vaccine doses touched down. In phase 1 of the vaccination programme, only healthcare workers in the public and private sector are being vaccinated as they are most at risk to Covid-19 infection. They are being vaccinated as part of the Sisonke Protocol, a study, which allows government to rollout the vaccine to health workers while awaiting the necessary approvals from the SA Health Products Regulator. In terms of Covid-19 infections, he said there were 683 new infections, as well as 125 new deaths, which took the country’s death toll since March last year to 50 803 deaths. This takes South Africa’s Covid-19 infections to over 1.5 million infections since March. The number of recoveries in the country stands at over 1.4 million recoveries, which means there is a recovery rate of about 94.7% currently. Mkhize said they had now tested over 9.2 million people in the private and public sector, with over 13 000 tests conducted in the past 24 hours. The North West, Free State and Northern Cape  provinces had the most deaths.
