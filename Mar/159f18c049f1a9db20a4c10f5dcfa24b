Meanwhile, US treasury yields steadied at the end of last week as the market sold off initially, following a stronger non-farm payrolls release, but mild short-covering kicked in as selling dried up after 7-year and 10-year yields ticked above last week’s highs. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.37 percent weaker at R15.34/$, after trading in range of R15.23/$ - R15.40/$. The rand traded in a narrow band overnight.
