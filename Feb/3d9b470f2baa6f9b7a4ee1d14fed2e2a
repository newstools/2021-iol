By Polina Devitt and Gabrielle TÃ©trault-Farber MOSCOW - Russia has registered the first case of a strain of bird flu virus named A(H5N8) being passed to humans from birds and has reported the matter to the World Health Organization (WHO), Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said on Saturday. Outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and North Africa in recent months but only in poultry. Other strains - H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 - have been known to spread to humans. Russia reported the case of human infection to the WHO"several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results," Popova said on Rossiya 24 state TV. There was no sign of transmission between humans so far, she added. The majority of human bird flu infections have been associated with direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered to be safe. Bird flu outbreaks often prompt poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus from spreading, and avoid importing countries having to impose trade restrictions. The vast majority of cases are spread by migrating wild birds, so producing countries tend to keep their poultry in doors or protected from contact with wildlife. Seven workers at a poultry plant in Russia's south had been infected with the H5N8 strain when there was an outbreak at theplant in December, Popova said, adding that the individuals involved felt fine now. "This situation did not develop further," she added. Siberia's Vector Institute said on Saturday it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, RIA news agency reported. The WHO did not reply to a Reuters request for comment. REUTERS
