Cape Town - Alcohol drinkers and smokers will pay much more for their sins from today after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni presented his 2021 Budget to Parliament on Wednesday. Mboweni announced an 8 percent increase in the excise duties on alcohol and tobacco products. He also said that from today: “It is clear that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to negative social and health outcomes. Consumers do react to price increases, and higher prices should lead to lower consumption of alcohol products with positive spinoffs,” Mboweni said. IOL
