CAPE TOWN - Angola has officially decriminalised same-sex relationships and prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. According to various media sources, the landmark law decriminalising homosexuality adopted by Angola in 2019 which took effect on Thursday is viewed as a victory for LGBTQ+ rights, not only in the country, but also on a continent where same-sex relationships remain illegal in the majority of states. The ruling also means that anyone refusing to employ or provide services to individuals based on their sexual orientation may face up to two years in prison. According to Out.com, the changes originated in the first rewriting of the country’s penal code since gaining independence in 1975. Fantastic news!
