"The active and orderly management of people through ourborders is an important part of the countryâ€™s overall riskadjusted approach to control the spread of Covid-19," said Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. Motsoaledi will visit the at Lebombo Border Post, one ofthe four busiest land ports, on the border of Mozambique onMonday to monitor the processing of travellers.
