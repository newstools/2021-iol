Doubt over effectiveness of vaccines As South Africa awaits delivery of its first batch of vaccines, there are growing concerns internationally that the 501Y.V2 variant of the disease significantly reduces the efficacy of the lifesaving drugs. On Friday, Johnson & Johnson said their vaccine was 66 percent effective overall in preventing people from contracting multiple variants Covid-19. The company was reacting to the results of a global vaccine study which showed that the level of protection offered by vaccines varied significantly among the three continents where the large-scale trials are being conducted. Mid-trial results put the efficacy of vaccines in South Africa at just 57 percent. IOL
