Durban - A nurse who, with a colleague, allegedly made personal payments using the bank card of a patient who had died from Covid-19, was granted bail of R3 000 in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Sikhona Ngidi, 44, admitted to magistrate Melanie de Jager that he had been convicted of fraud in March 2012 and served a five-year sentence. His attorney, Sibahle Mchunu, read out an affidavit stating that he lived at Ndwedwe, was employed at the Busamed Gateway Private Hospital, earned R16 000 and supported a minor child who was solely dependent on him. He had told the court he would be able to afford bail of R1 000 with help from his brother. She told the court that her client feared that he would be in danger of losing his job should he remain in custody. She also said Ngidi planned to plead not guilty. The State opposed bail for Sandile Mhlane, 41, who was with him in the dock, because there was a warrant of arrest was out for him on another matter. The case came to light when the business partner of a person who died in St Augustine’s of Covid-19, where Mhlane is believed to have worked, noticed the partner’s bank card was still being used. Using video footage, two people were arrested and goods that had been bought were recovered. The case was postponed to February 21. J Sibiya appeared for the State. The Independent on Saturday
