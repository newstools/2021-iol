Furthermore, there was no presence of the male person who came to the lodge with them.” Nasir was arrested in Brixton, Gauteng. “The motive behind this incident is still not clear at this stage, but domestic violence may not be ruled out. The police investigations are still under way,” said Ngoepe. African News Agency
