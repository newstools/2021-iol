South Africa is battling a second wave and a new variant of the Covid-9 virus. President Cyril Ramaphosa last week imposed an adjusted level 3 lockdown to curb the spread. On Sunday Mkhize said: "It is clear that the second wave that we are going through is affecting us to levels which are even higher than in the earlier stage. "The only way to deal with the Covid-19 not only in South Africa but throughout the world is the provision of the immunity through the vaccination.“ Mkhize said that the country's first main goal is to vaccinate 67 percent of the population, in order to achieve sufficient collective immunity to staunch the spread of the virus. He said that government hoped to obtain its first vaccine doses next month but cautioned that before that can happen negotiations must be concluded with vaccine makers including Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, as well as with Russian and Chinese laboratories.
