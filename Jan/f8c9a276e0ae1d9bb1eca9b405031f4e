Cape Town – Due to the barrage of challenges facing the country, the DA has written to Deputy President David Mabuza, in his capacity as leader of government business, to ask that Parliament be reconvened so that its members can address the many issues concerning South Africans before it’s too late the salvage the situation. Natasha Mazzone, chief whip of the official opposition, said in a statement on Friday that ’’after exhausting various avenues and numerous requests to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, for Parliament to reconvene on urgent matters, I have now reached out to the deputy president for his intervention’’. She said the ’’Speaker refuses to see the importance of members of Parliament being called together to act in the best interests of South Africans; call urgent meetings to debate these issues; and start the process of rectification before it is literally too late to do anything’’. Mazzone highlighted some of the issues that needed to be addressed urgently: ’’When the Covid-19 pandemic hit South Africa’s shores, the DA expressed its willingness to assist the government in its response. This offer is not off the table, and we have consistently given inputs where government was lacking and criticism where the government had failed. ’’South Africa urgently needs non-partisan solutions and cooperation to assist the government in dealing with this long list of challenges. ’’Parliament is the vehicle to achieve this. We have a job to do and we should not be stopped from robustly executing our role,“ Mazzone said. IOL
