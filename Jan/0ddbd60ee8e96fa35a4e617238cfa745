South African Weather Service (SAWS) forecaster Lulama Pheme added that the coast could also experience gale-force winds due to the choppy and gusty seas. “The threshold for heavy rain is 50 millimetres but we are expecting between 100 to 300 millimetres. Lives could be lost to the flooding if residents are not cautious. The usual rainfall was expected for Durban. Areas which have experienced heavy rainfall would be overly saturated and prone to flooding from normal rainfall in the week,” said Pheme. Pheme also said the effects of tropical storm Eloise would bring cooler weather conditions to Gauteng. “The temperatures are decreasing a bit. We are expecting warm conditions. We are looking at 60% chance of showers and thunder showers.” IOL
